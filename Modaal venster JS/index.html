            <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
            <h4>Access</h4>
            <p>
               “Access” marks the fourth release from Martin Garrix’s 2018 EP, BY LAW.
               Though it was premiered at Ultra Music Festival 2017 in Miami, Access was actually previewed by Martin himself a month earlier through a YouTube live. He notes at the end that he “might change everything and just keep the melodies,” which ended up not being the case.
               After Ultra’s premiere, the song quickly grasped a reaction from the fans, who then named the ID as “Chinatown” — Given beginning melody, which resembles the sound of a traditional chinese instrument, the Guzheng.

            <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
            <h4>So Far Away</h4>
            <p>
               “So Far Away” is a song about a couple who love each other, but can never make their relationship work. The song is the sixth original song of 2017 by Dutch DJ Martin Garrix, and is co-produced by, and features, French DJ David Guetta. The track features vocals from English songwriter Jamie Scott, and Romy Dya, a Dutch female vocalist.
               The original song was premiered on July 30, 2017 during Martin Garrix’s headline set at the electronic music festival, Tomorrowland. He brought out Guetta onstage and debuted the track.
               The track originally featured English singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding, but Garrix instead replaced her role on the track with Romy Dya, citing impatience with Goulding and her pushing back the release to work on her own music, eventually leading to her vocals being replaced. Ellie later clarified that her management and label were behind the decision, and that she loves the song.

            <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
            <h4>Waiting For Tommorow</h4>
            <p>
               Initially hinted at nearly three years prior to its release, “Waiting for Tomorrow” is the long-awaited collab between Martin Garrix and Linkin Park vocalist Mike Shinoda.
               The track was first teased on November 5, 2015, when Mike Shinoda posted a picture of himself in the studio with Martin Garrix on Instagram. Garrix posted a similar one the same day. Garrix' caption “Another day in the lab” pointed to their collaboration.
               In the following year, Martin Garrix headlined day one of Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Florida, where he debuted “Waiting For Tomorrow,” which featured vocals by Mike Shinoda.
               Around a month later, a studio version of the song was leaked on SoundCloud but minutes later was taken down. The title of the track indicated that DJ Pierce Fulton also contributed to the song.
               The song was subsequently confirmed via a leaked track listing of BYLAW, a five-track EP of Garrix’ intended for release during the week of Amsterdam Dance Event, commonly abbreviated as ADE.

            <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
            <h4>Burn Out</h4>
            <p>
               This song was first known as “Evolve”, when it was first premiered. Although release of song was hoped, Martijn said it will never be released.
               However at Tomorrowland 2018, he played the song alongside Justin Mylo on the STMPD RCRDS stage, with lyrics added- instead of a mash up between “Feel so close” by Calvin Harris. He then replied to his fan on Twitter, that this song will be released on September. The song was released with a collaboration with AXE music. AXE is also known as LYNX in the UK, and they have started to sell deodorants with the Martin Garrix sign on it.

            <h4>Don't Look Down</h4>
            <p>
               “Don’t Look Down” is a radio single from Martin Garrix’s debut full-length, +x. In this EDM track, Usher asks a prospective lover whether the feeling’s between them is mutual.
               On March 23rd, he released two music videos for the YouTube Music Awards 2015. Both feature a country club employee attempting to seduce a hot guest, except one stars a “Towel Boy”, and another stars a “Towel Girl”.
